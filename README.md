# UGArchive

UGArchive is my personal archive of school projects, notes, and other small programs written during my time in undergraduate studies at the University of Notre Dame.

## Engineering Computing (Spring 2022)

Engineering Computing was my first foray into computer science, taken in my second semester of freshman year. The class consisted of learning the basics of programming in Python and applying these basics towards several projects of varying length.

Of these projects, the most notable is my final project for the class: Crimes in Chicago. Using a publicly available API that tracks 1000 of the most recent crimes from the city of Chicago, I alongside my partner Kyle Newman created a Jupyter Notebook that plotted these crimes in an interactive map for users. The project contains 3 variations of maps, allowing for users to interact with crimes based on the type of crime, the community area they occurr in, and density of crimes.

In addition to the interactive maps, we also created some simple plots using the crime data to produce some insights about the frequency of certain crimes and more specific dives into community areas. This project was very heavily reliant on data parsing and handling, which offered great experience for future courses.
